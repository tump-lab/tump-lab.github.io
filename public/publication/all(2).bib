    abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way for accurate session-based recommendation (SBR), but they demand substantial computational time and memory. Knowledge distillation (KD)-based methods can alleviate these issues by transferring the knowledge to a small student, which trains a student based on the predictions of a cumbersome teacher. However, these methods encounter difficulties for LLM-based KD in SBR. 1) It is expensive to make LLMs predict for all instances in KD. 2) LLMs may make ineffective predictions for some instances in KD, e.g., incorrect predictions for hard instances or similar predictions as existing recommenders for easy instances. In this paper, we propose an active LLM-based KD method in SBR, contributing to sustainable AI. To efficiently distill knowledge from LLMs with limited cost, we propose to extract a small proportion of instances predicted by LLMs. Meanwhile, for a more effective distillation, we propose an active learning strategy to extract instances that are as effective as possible for KD from a theoretical view. Specifically, we first formulate gains based on potential effects (e.g., effective, similar, and incorrect predictions by LLMs) and difficulties (e.g., easy or hard to fit) of instances for KD. Then, we propose to maximize the minimal gains of distillation to find the optimal selection policy for active learning, which can largely avoid extracting ineffective instances in KD. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for SBR.},

To this end, we propose an Attentional Recurrent Neural Network (ARNN) to jointly model both the sequential regularity and transition regularities of similar locations (neighbors). In particular, we first design a meta-path based random walk over a novel knowledge graph to discover location neighbors based on heterogeneous factors. A recurrent neural network is then adopted to model the sequential regularity by capturing various contexts that govern user mobility. Meanwhile, the transition regularities of the discovered neighbors are integrated via the attention mechanism, which seamlessly cooperates with the sequential regularity as a unified recurrent framework. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ARNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

    abstract = {New-items play a crucial role in recommender systems (RSs) for delivering fresh and engaging user experiences. However, traditional methods struggle to effectively recommend new-items due to their short exposure time and limited interaction records, especially in dynamic recommender systems (DRSs) where new-items get continuously introduced and users' preferences evolve over time. This leads to significant unfairness towards new-items, which could accumulate over the successive model updates, ultimately compromising the stability of the entire system. Therefore, we propose FairAgent, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based new-item fairness enhancement framework specifically designed for DRSs. It leverages knowledge distillation to extract collaborative signals from traditional models, retaining strong recommendation capabilities for old-items. In addition, FairAgent introduces a novel reward mechanism for recommendation tailored to the characteristics of DRSs, which consists of three components: 1) a new-item exploration reward to promote the exposure of dynamically introduced new-items, 2) a fairness reward to adapt to users' personalized fairness requirements for new-items, and 3) an accuracy reward which leverages users' dynamic feedback to enhance recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and backbone models demonstrate the superior performance of FairAgent.},

    abstract = {Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has been incorporated to address the sparsity issue, leading to longer training time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1) compared to other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior performance under sparse interactions even with SSL; (2) more complex models tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms, like attention mechanisms, can be detrimental as they often increase learning difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node similarity in the original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8% in recommendation accuracy and saves 84.3% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL.},

However, while most prior works analyze the effects of perturbing every pixel of every frame assuming white-box policy access, in this paper we take a more restrictive view towards adversary generation - with the goal of unveiling the limits of a model's vulnerability. In particular, we explore minimalistic attacks by defining three key settings: (1) black-box policy access: where the attacker only has access to the input (state) and output (action probability) of an RL policy; (2) fractional-state adversary: where only several pixels are perturbed, with the extreme case being a single-pixel adversary; and (3) tactically-chanced attack: where only significant frames are tactically chosen to be attacked. We formulate the adversarial attack by accommodating the three key settings and explore their potency on six Atari games by examining four fully trained state-of-the-art policies. In Breakout, for example, we surprisingly find that: (i) all policies showcase significant performance degradation by merely modifying 0.01% of the input state, and (ii) the policy trained by DQN is totally deceived by perturbation to only 1% frames.},

    abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies have been shown to be deceived by perturbations (e.g., random noise or intensional adversarial attacks) on state observations that appear at test time but are unknown during training. To increase the robustness of DRL policies, previous approaches assume that the knowledge of adversaries can be added into the training process to achieve the corresponding generalization ability on these perturbed observations. However, such an assumption not only makes the robustness improvement more expensive but may also leave a model less effective to other kinds of attacks in the wild. In contrast, we propose an adversary agnostic robust DRL paradigm that does not require learning from adversaries. To this end, we first theoretically derive that robustness could indeed be achieved independently of the adversaries based on a policy distillation setting. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new policy distillation loss with two terms: 1) a prescription gap maximization loss aiming at simultaneously maximizing the likelihood of the action selected by the teacher policy and the entropy over the remaining actions; 2) a corresponding Jacobian regularization loss that minimizes the magnitude of the gradient with respect to the input state. The theoretical analysis shows that our distillation loss guarantees to increase the prescription gap and the adversarial robustness. Furthermore, experiments on five Atari games firmly verify the superiority of our approach in terms of boosting adversarial robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

Most existing methods, however, are insufficient to exploit the KGs for capturing user preferences, as they either represent the user-item connectivities via paths with limited expressiveness or implicitly model them by propagating information over the entire KG with inevitable noise. In this paper, we design a novel hierarchical attentive knowledge graph embedding (HAKG) framework to exploit the KGs for effective recommendation. Specifically, HAKG first extracts the expressive subgraphs that link user-item pairs to characterize their connectivities, which accommodate both the semantics and topology of KGs. The subgraphs are then encoded via a hierarchical attentive subgraph encoding to generate effective subgraph embeddings for enhanced user preference prediction. Extensive experiments show the superiority of HAKG against state-of-the-art recommendation methods, as well as its potential in alleviating the data sparsity issue.},

We show in real-world datasets that feature relationships in horizontal dimension can help explain and further model user-item interactions. To fully exploit FH, we propose a unified recommendation framework that seamlessly incorporates both vertical and horizontal dimensions for effective recommendation. Our model further considers two types of semantically rich feature relationships in horizontal dimension, i.e. complementary and alternative relationships. Extensive validation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach against the state of the art.

Specifically, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with side information from two orthogonal perspectives. One involves the different methodologies of recommendation: the memory-based methods, latent factor, representation learning, and deep learning models. The others cover different representations of side information, including structural data (flat, network, and hierarchical features, and knowledge graphs); and non-structural data (text, image and video features). Finally, we discuss challenges and provide new potential directions in recommendation, along with the conclusion of this survey.},

    abstract = {Recently, one critical issue looms large in the field of recommender systems -- there are no effective benchmarks for rigorous evaluation -- which consequently leads to unreproducible evaluation and unfair comparison. We, therefore, conduct studies from the perspectives of practical theory and experiments, aiming at benchmarking recommendation for rigorous evaluation. Regarding the theoretical study, a series of hyper-factors affecting recommendation performance throughout the whole evaluation chain are systematically summarized and analyzed via an exhaustive review on 141 papers published at eight top-tier venues. From the experimental study, we establish a unified, highly modularized, and extensively compared benchmark for rigorous evaluation, which consists of 19 recommendation algorithms, 27 datasets, and 12 evaluation metrics. The benchmark takes account of the significant impact of different hyper-factors on recommendation performance, which can facilitate rigorous evaluation and fair comparison. Extensive experiments on the benchmark show that our theoretical analysis are well supported and that several insights are drawn from the experiments. The benchmark will be made publicly available at https://github.com/recsys-benchmark/DaisyRec-v2.0.},

    abstract = {Current study on next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation mainly explores user sequential transitions with the fine-grained individual-user POI check-in trajectories only, which suffers from the severe check-in data sparsity issue. In fact, coarse-grained signals (i.e., region- and global-level check-ins) in such sparse check-ins would also benefit to augment user preference learning. Specifically, our data analysis unveils that user movement exhibits noticeable patterns w.r.t. the regions of visited POIs. Meanwhile, the global all-user check-ins can help reflect sequential regularities shared by the crowd. We are, therefore, inspired to propose the MCMG: a Multi-Channel next POI recommendation framework with Multi-Granularity signals categorized from two orthogonal perspectives, i.e., fine-coarse grained check-ins at either POI/region level or local/global level. The MCMG is equipped with three modules, namely, global user behavior encoder, local multi-channel (i.e., region, category, and POI channels) encoder, and region-aware weighting strategy. Such design enables MCMG to be capable of capturing both fine- and coarse-grained sequential regularities as well as exploring the dynamic impact of multi-channel by differentiating the check-in patterns w.r.t. visited regions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our MCMG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art next POI recommendation approaches.},

    abstract = {Product bundling represents a prevalent marketing strategy in both offline stores and e-commerce systems. Despite its widespread use, previous studies on bundle recommendation face two significant limitations. Firstly, they rely on noisy datasets, where bundles are defined by heuristics, e.g., products co-purchased in the same session. Secondly, they target specific tasks by holding unrealistic assumptions, e.g., the availability of bundles for recommendation directly. This paper proposes to take a step back and considers the process of bundle recommendation from a holistic user experience perspective. We first construct high-quality bundle datasets with rich metadata, particularly bundle intents, through a carefully designed crowd-sourcing task. We then define a series of tasks that together, support all key steps in a typical bundle recommendation process, from bundle detection, completion and ranking, to explanation and auto-naming, whereby 19 research questions are raised correspondingly to guide the analysis. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and analyses with representative recommendation models and large language models (LLMs), demonstrating the challenges and opportunities, especially with the emergence of LLMs. To summarize, our study contributes by introducing novel data sources, paving the way for new research avenues, and offering insights to guide product bundling in real e-commerce platforms.},

    abstract = {Social recommendations (SRs) aim to enhance preference modeling by integrating social networks. However, their effectiveness is mainly constrained by two factors: the noisy social connections that may not reflect shared interests, and the limited number of social connections for most users, which hampers the system's ability to fully leverage social influence. Therefore, it is essential to perform social network refinement by removing noisy connections and adding meaningful ones for robust SRs. Inspired by the denoising capability of generative diffusion models, we propose a Model-Agnostic Social Network Refinement framework with Diffusion Models for Robust Social Recommendation (ARD-SR). Specifically, in the forward process, we corrupt the social network by progressively adding position-specific Gaussian noise calibrated to the user preference similarity, better simulating how the social network responds to noise perturbations. The reverse process learns to denoise, guided by each user's neighborhood preferences from the SR backbone, generating a tailored social network aligned with each user's preference for establishing connections. For effective learning, we design a curriculum-based training mechanism that progressively introduces challenging samples characterized by high sparsity or high noise levels. To further enhance the quality of the refined social network, (1) we introduce a preference-guided flip operation during inference to improve the input quality; and (2) we modify social connections based on the exponential weighted moving average of ARD-SR's predictions across epochs to reduce fluctuations. Experiments on three datasets show that ARD-SR significantly improves SR performance across multiple SR backbones. The code is released at https://github.com/sunyc123r/ARD-SR.},

However, prompt-based methods often struggle to find ideal prompts without task-specific feedback, while fine-tuning-based methods are hindered by high computational demands and dependence on open-source backbones. To address these challenges, we propose a Reflective Reinforcement Large Language Model (Re2LLM) for session-based recommendation, which refines LLMs to generate and utilize specialized knowledge effectively and efficiently. Specifically, we first devise the Reflective Exploration Module to extract and present knowledge in a form that LLMs can easily process. This module enables LLMs to reflect on their recommendation mistakes and construct a hint knowledge base to rectify them effectively. Next, we design the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent that elicits correct LLM reasoning. This module recognizes hints as signals to facilitate LLM recommendations and learns to select appropriate hints from the constructed knowledge base using task-specific feedback efficiently. Lastly, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate the superiority of our Re2LLM over state-of-the-art methods.},

Accordingly, BERD+ models both the loss and uncertainty of each instance via a Gaussian distribution, whereby a heterogeneous uncertainty-aware graph convolution network is designed to learn accurate embeddings for different entities while reducing the disturbance caused by uncertain attribute values.

However, users can be induced by external distractions to click on items inconsistent with their true preferences, resulting in unreliable training instances with mismatched input-target pairs. To resist unreliable data, researchers attempt to develop Robust SRs (RSRs). However, our data analysis unveils that existing RSRs are data-driven. That is, for most instances formed by infrequently co-occurred items, existing RSRs are uncertain about their reliability. To fill this gap, we propose a generic framework -- LLM4RSR (Large Language Models for Robust Sequential Recommendation) -- to semantically complement data-driven RSRs by correcting uncertain instances into reliable ones based on LLMs' semantic comprehension of items beyond co-occurrence. In this way, RSRs can be re-trained with the corrected data for better accuracy. This is a selective knowledge distillation procedure, where the LLM acts as a teacher guiding student RSRs via uncertain instances. To align LLMs with the data correction task and mitigate inherent hallucinations, we equip the LLM with profile, plan, and memory modules, which are automatically optimized via textual gradient descent, eliminating the need for human effort and expertise. Experiments on four real-world datasets spanning eight backbones verify the generality, effectiveness, and efficiency of LLM4RSR.},

    abstract = {Current session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) mainly focus on maximizing recommendation accuracy, while few studies have been devoted to improve diversity beyond accuracy. Meanwhile, it is unclear how the accuracy-oriented SBRSs perform in terms of diversity. In addition, the asserted “tradeoff” relationship between accuracy and diversity has been increasingly questioned in the literature. Toward the aforementioned issues, we conduct a holistic study to particularly examine the recommendation performance of representative SBRSs w.r.t. both accuracy and diversity, striving for better understanding of the diversity-related issues for SBRSs and providing guidance on designing diversified SBRSs. Particularly, for a fair and thorough comparison, we deliberately select state-of-the-art non-neural, deep neural, and diversified SBRSs by covering more scenarios with appropriate experimental setups, e.g., representative datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyper-parameter optimization technique. The source code can be obtained via github.com/qyin863/Understanding-Diversity-in-SBRSs . Our empirical results unveil that (1) non-diversified methods can also obtain satisfying performance on diversity, which can even surpass diversified ones, and (2) the relationship between accuracy and diversity is quite complex. Besides the “tradeoff” relationship, they can be positively correlated with each other, that is, having a same-trend (win–win or lose–lose) relationship, which varies across different methods and datasets. Additionally, we further identify three possible influential factors on diversity in SBRSs (i.e., granularity of item categorization, session diversity of datasets, and length of recommendation lists) and offer an intuitive guideline and a potential solution regarding learned item embeddings for more effective session-based recommendation.},

    abstract = {In recent years, session-based recommender systems (SRSs) have emerged as a significant research focus within the recommendation field. Capturing user intentions to infer user interest accordingly has proven to be effective in enhancing the accuracy of SRSs. However, existing techniques assume that all sessions have the same number of intentions or that the items in one category belonging to the same session reflect the same intention. In real applications, such as e-commerce, sessions may have different numbers of intentions, and the same type of items in a session may correspond to different intentions. As a result, existing techniques cannot guarantee high-quality user interest prediction. In this article, we propose a novel Adaptive Intention Learning Network (AILN) to capture an adaptive number of intentions for each session, thereby enhancing the accuracy of user interest inference. Specifically, we design an intention evaluation network (IEN) to evaluate whether a subsequence of a session corresponds to a valid intention, and an intention generation network (IGN) to learn the representation of a valid intention. By checking each subsequence of a session, IEN and IGN enable the incremental learning of a session-specific intention hierarchy (IH) to store valid intentions of the session. To reduce the cost of building the IH, we propose a pruning strategy that exploits the intention validity to avoid unnecessary evaluation. The representative intentions are selected from IH and input into a designed interest predictor to infer the user interest. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed AILN.},

    abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to provide personalized recommendations to users. Recently, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely introduced in RSs to improve recommendation accuracy. In this study, however, we demonstrate that RSs do not necessarily perform worse even if the KG is downgraded to the user-item interaction graph only (or removed). We propose an evaluation framework KG4RecEval to systematically evaluate how much a KG contributes to the recommendation accuracy of a KG-based RS, using our defined metric KGER (KG utilization efficiency in recommendation). We consider the scenarios where knowledge in a KG gets completely removed, randomly distorted and decreased, and also where recommendations are for cold-start users. Our extensive experiments on four commonly used datasets and a number of state-of-the-art KG-based RSs reveal that: to remove, randomly distort or decrease knowledge does not necessarily decrease recommendation accuracy, even for cold-start users. These findings inspire us to rethink how to better utilize knowledge from existing KGs, whereby we discuss and provide insights into what characteristics of datasets and KG-based RSs may help improve KG utilization efficiency.

    abstract = {In recent years, dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been proposed to capture comprehensive user preferences in order to ultimately enhance the recommendation accuracy in both data-richer and data-sparser domains simultaneously. However, in addition to users’ true preferences, the user–item interactions might also be affected by confounders (e.g., free shipping, sales promotion). As a result, dual-target CDR has to meet two challenges: (1) how to effectively decouple observed confounders, including single-domain confounders and cross-domain confounders, and (2) how to preserve the positive effects of observed confounders on predicted interactions, while eliminating their negative effects on capturing comprehensive user preferences. To address the above two challenges, we propose a Causal Deconfounding Framework via Confounder Disentanglement for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CD2CDR) . In CD2CDR, we first propose a confounder disentanglement module to effectively decouple observed single-domain and cross-domain confounders. We then propose a causal deconfounding module to preserve the positive effects of such observed confounders and eliminate their negative effects via backdoor adjustment, thereby enhancing the recommendation accuracy in each domain. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CD2CDR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},
