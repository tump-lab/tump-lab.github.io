 abstract = {Recently, one critical issue looms large in the field of recommender systems -- there are no effective benchmarks for rigorous evaluation -- which consequently leads to unreproducible evaluation and unfair comparison. We, therefore, conduct studies from the perspectives of practical theory and experiments, aiming at benchmarking recommendation for rigorous evaluation. Regarding the theoretical study, a series of hyper-factors affecting recommendation performance throughout the whole evaluation chain are systematically summarized and analyzed via an exhaustive review on 141 papers published at eight top-tier venues. From the experimental study, we establish a unified, highly modularized, and extensively compared benchmark for rigorous evaluation, which consists of 19 recommendation algorithms, 27 datasets, and 12 evaluation metrics. The benchmark takes account of the significant impact of different hyper-factors on recommendation performance, which can facilitate rigorous evaluation and fair comparison. Extensive experiments on the benchmark show that our theoretical analysis are well supported and that several insights are drawn from the experiments. The benchmark will be made publicly available at https://github.com/recsys-benchmark/DaisyRec-v2.0.},
