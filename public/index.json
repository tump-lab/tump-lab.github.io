Knowledge distillation (KD)-based methods can alleviate these issues by transferring the knowledge to a small student, which trains a student based on the predictions of a cumbersome teacher. However, these methods encounter difficulties for LLM-based KD in SBR. 1) It is expensive to make LLMs predict for all instances in KD. 2) LLMs may make ineffective predictions for some instances in KD, e.g., incorrect predictions for hard instances or similar predictions as existing recommenders for easy instances. In this paper, we propose an active LLM-based KD method in SBR, contributing to sustainable AI. To efficiently distill knowledge from LLMs with limited cost, we propose to extract a small proportion of instances predicted by LLMs. Meanwhile, for a more effective distillation, we propose an active learning strategy to extract instances that are as effective as possible for KD from a theoretical view. Specifically, we first formulate gains based on potential effects (e.g., effective, similar, and incorrect predictions by LLMs) and difficulties (e.g., easy or hard to fit) of instances for KD. Then, we propose to maximize the minimal gains of distillation to find the optimal selection policy for active learning, which can largely avoid extracting ineffective instances in KD.

However, in addition to users’ true preferences, the user–item interactions might also be affected by confounders (e.g., free shipping, sales promotion). As a result, dual-target CDR has to meet two challenges: (1) how to effectively decouple observed confounders, including single-domain confounders and cross-domain confounders, and (2) how to preserve the positive effects of observed confounders on predicted interactions, while eliminating their negative effects on capturing comprehensive user preferences. To address the above two challenges, we propose a Causal Deconfounding Framework via Confounder Disentanglement for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CD2CDR) . In CD2CDR, we first propose a confounder disentanglement module to effectively decouple observed single-domain and cross-domain confounders. We then propose a causal deconfounding module to preserve the positive effects of such observed confounders and eliminate their negative effects via backdoor adjustment, thereby enhancing the recommendation accuracy in each domain.

However, traditional methods struggle to effectively recommend new-items due to their short exposure time and limited interaction records, especially in dynamic recommender systems (DRSs) where new-items get continuously introduced and users' preferences evolve over time. This leads to significant unfairness towards new-items, which could accumulate over the successive model updates, ultimately compromising the stability of the entire system. Therefore, we propose FairAgent, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based new-item fairness enhancement framework specifically designed for DRSs. It leverages knowledge distillation to extract collaborative signals from traditional models, retaining strong recommendation capabilities for old-items. In addition, FairAgent introduces a novel reward mechanism for recommendation tailored to the characteristics of DRSs, which consists of three components: 1) a new-item exploration reward to promote the exposure of dynamically introduced new-items, 2) a fairness reward to adapt to users' personalized fairness requirements for new-items, and 3) an accuracy reward which leverages users' dynamic feedback to enhance recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and backbone models demonstrate the superior performance of FairAgent.","tags":null,"title":"Enhancing New-item Fairness in Dynamic Recommender Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haonan Zhang","Dongxia Wang","Zhu Sun","Yanhui Li","Youcheng Sun","Huizhi Lian","Wenhai Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"fbc8de54621727c61ace9075c91f8332","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/zhang-2025-tois/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.963796Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/zhang-2025-tois/","section":"publication","summary":"Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to provide personalized recommendations to users. Recently, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely introduced in RSs to improve recommendation accuracy. In this study, however, we demonstrate that RSs do not necessarily perform worse even if the KG is downgraded to the user-item interaction graph only (or removed). We propose an evaluation framework KG4RecEval to systematically evaluate how much a KG contributes to the recommendation accuracy of a KG-based RS, using our defined metric KGER (KG utilization efficiency in recommendation). We consider the scenarios where knowledge in a KG gets completely removed, randomly distorted and decreased, and also where recommendations are for cold-start users. Our extensive experiments on four commonly used datasets and a number of state-of-the-art KG-based RSs reveal that: to remove, randomly distort or decrease knowledge does not necessarily decrease recommendation accuracy, even for cold-start users. These findings inspire us to rethink how to better utilize knowledge from existing KGs, whereby we discuss and provide insights into what characteristics of datasets and KG-based RSs may help improve KG utilization efficiency.

Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has been incorporated to address the sparsity issue, leading to longer training time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1) compared to other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior performance under sparse interactions even with SSL; (2) more complex models tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms, like attention mechanisms, can be detrimental as they often increase learning difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node similarity in the original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time.

However, users can be induced by external distractions to click on items inconsistent with their true preferences, resulting in unreliable training instances with mismatched input-target pairs. To resist unreliable data, researchers attempt to develop Robust SRs (RSRs). However, our data analysis unveils that existing RSRs are data-driven. That is, for most instances formed by infrequently co-occurred items, existing RSRs are uncertain about their reliability. To fill this gap, we propose a generic framework -- LLM4RSR (Large Language Models for Robust Sequential Recommendation) -- to semantically complement data-driven RSRs by correcting uncertain instances into reliable ones based on LLMs' semantic comprehension of items beyond co-occurrence. In this way, RSRs can be re-trained with the corrected data for better accuracy. This is a selective knowledge distillation procedure, where the LLM acts as a teacher guiding student RSRs via uncertain instances. To align LLMs with the data correction task and mitigate inherent hallucinations, we equip the LLM with profile, plan, and memory modules, which are automatically optimized via textual gradient descent, eliminating the need for human effort and expertise.

However, their effectiveness is mainly constrained by two factors: the noisy social connections that may not reflect shared interests, and the limited number of social connections for most users, which hampers the system's ability to fully leverage social influence. Therefore, it is essential to perform social network refinement by removing noisy connections and adding meaningful ones for robust SRs. Inspired by the denoising capability of generative diffusion models, we propose a Model-Agnostic Social Network Refinement framework with Diffusion Models for Robust Social Recommendation (ARD-SR). Specifically, in the forward process, we corrupt the social network by progressively adding position-specific Gaussian noise calibrated to the user preference similarity, better simulating how the social network responds to noise perturbations. The reverse process learns to denoise, guided by each user's neighborhood preferences from the SR backbone, generating a tailored social network aligned with each user's preference for establishing connections. For effective learning, we design a curriculum-based training mechanism that progressively introduces challenging samples characterized by high sparsity or high noise levels. To further enhance the quality of the refined social network, (1) we introduce a preference-guided flip operation during inference to improve the input quality; and (2) we modify social connections based on the exponential weighted moving average of ARD-SR's predictions across epochs to reduce fluctuations. Experiments on three datasets show that ARD-SR significantly improves SR performance across multiple SR backbones.

Capturing user intentions to infer user interest accordingly has proven to be effective in enhancing the accuracy of SRSs. However, existing techniques assume that all sessions have the same number of intentions or that the items in one category belonging to the same session reflect the same intention. In real applications, such as e-commerce, sessions may have different numbers of intentions, and the same type of items in a session may correspond to different intentions. As a result, existing techniques cannot guarantee high-quality user interest prediction. In this article, we propose a novel Adaptive Intention Learning Network (AILN) to capture an adaptive number of intentions for each session, thereby enhancing the accuracy of user interest inference. Specifically, we design an intention evaluation network (IEN) to evaluate whether a subsequence of a session corresponds to a valid intention, and an intention generation network (IGN) to learn the representation of a valid intention. By checking each subsequence of a session, IEN and IGN enable the incremental learning of a session-specific intention hierarchy (IH) to store valid intentions of the session.

Despite its widespread use, previous studies on bundle recommendation face two significant limitations. Firstly, they rely on noisy datasets, where bundles are defined by heuristics, e.g., products co-purchased in the same session. Secondly, they target specific tasks by holding unrealistic assumptions, e.g., the availability of bundles for recommendation directly. This paper proposes to take a step back and considers the process of bundle recommendation from a holistic user experience perspective. We first construct high-quality bundle datasets with rich metadata, particularly bundle intents, through a carefully designed crowd-sourcing task. We then define a series of tasks that together, support all key steps in a typical bundle recommendation process, from bundle detection, completion and ranking, to explanation and auto-naming, whereby 19 research questions are raised correspondingly to guide the analysis. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and analyses with representative recommendation models and large language models (LLMs), demonstrating the challenges and opportunities, especially with the emergence of LLMs. To summarize, our study contributes by introducing novel data sources, paving the way for new research avenues, and offering insights to guide product bundling in real e-commerce platforms.","tags":null,"title":"Revisiting Bundle Recommendation for Intent-aware Product Bundling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Youchen Sun (PhD, NTU, Singapore)","Zhu Sun","Yingpeng Du","Jie Zhang","Yew-Soon Ong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"a77632954875a0818ea6a25ff875f15d","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/youchen-2024-kdd/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.938816Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/youchen-2024-kdd/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Self-Supervised Denoising through Independent Cascade Graph Augmentation for Robust Social Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haoyan Chua","Yingpeng Du","Zhu Sun","Ziyan Wang","Jie Zhang","Yew-Soon Ong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"69bceeeec2c245e155f5fe45ceb31cca","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/chua-2024-recsys/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.717492Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/chua-2024-recsys/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Unified Denoising Training for Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shanshan Feng","Haoming Lyu","Fan Li","Zhu Sun","Caishun Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"902b2168d9cb104735fc4b544ae1d074","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/feng-2024-cai/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.732377Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/feng-2024-cai/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Where to Move Next: Zero-shot Generalization of LLMs for Next POI Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huizi Wu","Hui Fang","Zhu Sun","Cong Geng","Yew-Soon Ong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"c0910f79021d798a86e6ecbb3fa277ad","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/wu-2023-icde/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.901621Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/wu-2023-icde/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Generic Reinforced Explainable Framework with Knowledge Graph for Session-based Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Yu Lei","Lu Zhang","Chen Li","Yew-Soon Ong","Jie Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"c97deb50d3db5fb6c80aba0dcf80d9b0","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2023-tois-poi/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.871703Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2023-tois-poi/","section":"publication","summary":"Current study on next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation mainly explores user sequential transitions with the fine-grained individual-user POI check-in trajectories only, which suffers from the severe check-in data sparsity issue. In fact, coarse-grained signals (i.e., region- and global-level check-ins) in such sparse check-ins would also benefit to augment user preference learning. Specifically, our data analysis unveils that user movement exhibits noticeable patterns w.r.t. the regions of visited POIs. Meanwhile, the global all-user check-ins can help reflect sequential regularities shared by the crowd. We are, therefore, inspired to propose the MCMG: a Multi-Channel next POI recommendation framework with Multi-Granularity signals categorized from two orthogonal perspectives, i.e., fine-coarse grained check-ins at either POI/region level or local/global level. The MCMG is equipped with three modules, namely, global user behavior encoder, local multi-channel (i.e., region, category, and POI channels) encoder, and region-aware weighting strategy. Such design enables MCMG to be capable of capturing both fine- and coarse-grained sequential regularities as well as exploring the dynamic impact of multi-channel by differentiating the check-in patterns w.r.t. visited regions.

We, for the first time , verify SRSs can be misguided by such unreliable instances and design a generic SRS framework B y E liminating un R eliable D ata (BERD+), which can be flexibly plugged into existing SRSs. Specifically, BRED+ is guided with observations on the training process of instances: Unreliable instances generally have high training loss; high-loss instances are not necessarily unreliable but uncertain ones caused by blurry sequential patterns; and item attributes help rectify instance loss and uncertainty, but may also introduce disturbance. Accordingly, BERD+ models both the loss and uncertainty of each instance via a Gaussian distribution, whereby a heterogeneous uncertainty-aware graph convolution network is designed to learn accurate embeddings for different entities while reducing the disturbance caused by uncertain attribute values. Thereafter, an explicit preference extractor rectifies instance loss and uncertainty and reduces the disturbance caused by less-focused attribute types.

Meanwhile, it is unclear how the accuracy-oriented SBRSs perform in terms of diversity. In addition, the asserted “tradeoff” relationship between accuracy and diversity has been increasingly questioned in the literature. Toward the aforementioned issues, we conduct a holistic study to particularly examine the recommendation performance of representative SBRSs w.r.t. both accuracy and diversity, striving for better understanding of the diversity-related issues for SBRSs and providing guidance on designing diversified SBRSs. Particularly, for a fair and thorough comparison, we deliberately select state-of-the-art non-neural, deep neural, and diversified SBRSs by covering more scenarios with appropriate experimental setups, e.g., representative datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyper-parameter optimization technique. The source code can be obtained via github.com/qyin863/Understanding-Diversity-in-SBRSs . Our empirical results unveil that (1) non-diversified methods can also obtain satisfying performance on diversity, which can even surpass diversified ones, and (2) the relationship between accuracy and diversity is quite complex. Besides the “tradeoff” relationship, they can be positively correlated with each other, that is, having a same-trend (win–win or lose–lose) relationship, which varies across different methods and datasets. Additionally, we further identify three possible influential factors on diversity in SBRSs (i.e., granularity of item categorization, session diversity of datasets, and length of recommendation lists) and offer an intuitive guideline and a potential solution regarding learned item embeddings for more effective session-based recommendation.","tags":null,"title":"Understanding Diversity in Session-based Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Zhuoyi Lin","Sheng Zang","Rundong Wang","Zhu Sun","Chee Keong Kwoh","Chi Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"96a9ca12416e28124602360d57ee0245","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/lin-2022-tkde/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.782038Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/lin-2022-tkde/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Attention over Self-attention: Dynamic Re-ranking with User Intentions for Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu Zhang","Zhu Sun","Jie Zhang","Yiwen Wu","Yunwen Xia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"955b1fe64c3ae414c8272a491d634f0d","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/zhang-2022-tnnls/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.953219Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/zhang-2022-tnnls/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Conversation-based Adaptive Relational Translation Method for Next POI Recommendation with Uncertain Check-ins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Hui Fang","Jie Yang","Xinghua Qu","Hongyang Liu","Di Yu","Yew-Soon Ong","Jie Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"a8bc3660283b123d5dc8af55fa6da339","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2022-tpami/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.867871Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2022-tpami/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently, one critical issue looms large in the field of recommender systems -- there are no effective benchmarks for rigorous evaluation -- which consequently leads to unreproducible evaluation and unfair comparison.

From the experimental study, we establish a unified, highly modularized, and extensively compared benchmark for rigorous evaluation, which consists of 19 recommendation algorithms, 27 datasets, and 12 evaluation metrics. The benchmark takes account of the significant impact of different hyper-factors on recommendation performance, which can facilitate rigorous evaluation and fair comparison.

They, however, completely ignore the impact of future behaviors on the decision-making, thus hindering the quality of user preference learning. Intuitively, users' next POI visits may also be affected by their multi-step future behaviors, as users may often have activity planning in mind. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Context-aware Future Preference inference Recommender (CFPRec) to help infer user future preference in a self-ensembling manner. In particular, it delicately derives multi-step future preferences from the learned past preference thanks to the periodic property of users' daily check-ins, so as to implicitly mimic user’s activity planning before her next visit.

To increase the robustness of DRL policies, previous approaches assume that the knowledge of adversaries can be added into the training process to achieve the corresponding generalization ability on these perturbed observations. However, such an assumption not only makes the robustness improvement more expensive but may also leave a model less effective to other kinds of attacks in the wild. In contrast, we propose an adversary agnostic robust DRL paradigm that does not require learning from adversaries. To this end, we first theoretically derive that robustness could indeed be achieved independently of the adversaries based on a policy distillation setting. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new policy distillation loss with two terms: 1) a prescription gap maximization loss aiming at simultaneously maximizing the likelihood of the action selected by the teacher policy and the entropy over the remaining actions; 2) a corresponding Jacobian regularization loss that minimizes the magnitude of the gradient with respect to the input state. The theoretical analysis shows that our distillation loss guarantees to increase the prescription gap and the adversarial robustness. Furthermore, experiments on five Atari games firmly verify the superiority of our approach in terms of boosting adversarial robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods.","tags":null,"title":"Adversary Agnostic Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiao Sha","Zhu Sun","Jie Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"a53d8ce6badfb739585f85743ba815bc","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/sha-2021-tcss/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.822352Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/sha-2021-tcss/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Disentangling Multi-facet Social Relations for Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yatong Sun (PhD, MQ, Australia)","Bin Wang","Zhu Sun","Xiaochun Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"187b8e5e900e49b3309079c6305b12da","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/yatong-2021-ijcai/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.915586Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/yatong-2021-ijcai/","section":"publication","summary":"Most sequential recommender systems (SRSs) predict next-item as target for each user given its preceding items as input, assuming that each input is related to its target.

This inspires us to design a novel SRS By Eliminating unReliable Data (BERD) guided with two observations: (1) unreliable instances generally have high training loss; and (2) high-loss instances are not necessarily unreliable but uncertain ones caused by blurry sequential pattern. Accordingly, BERD models both loss and uncertainty of each instance via a Gaussian distribution to better distinguish unreliable instances; meanwhile an uncertainty-aware graph convolution network is exploited to assist in mining unreliable instances by lowering uncertainty.

However, while most prior works analyze the effects of perturbing every pixel of every frame assuming white-box policy access, in this paper we take a more restrictive view towards adversary generation - with the goal of unveiling the limits of a model's vulnerability. In particular, we explore minimalistic attacks by defining three key settings: (1) black-box policy access: where the attacker only has access to the input (state) and output (action probability) of an RL policy; (2) fractional-state adversary: where only several pixels are perturbed, with the extreme case being a single-pixel adversary; and (3) tactically-chanced attack: where only significant frames are tactically chosen to be attacked. We formulate the adversarial attack by accommodating the three key settings and explore their potency on six Atari games by examining four fully trained state-of-the-art policies. In Breakout, for example, we surprisingly find that: (i) all policies showcase significant performance degradation by merely modifying 0.01% of the input state, and (ii) the policy trained by DQN is totally deceived by perturbation to only 1% frames.","tags":null,"title":"Minimalistic Attacks: How Little it Takes to Fool a Deep Reinforcement Learning Policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu Zhang","Zhu Sun","Jie Zhang","Horst Kloeden","Felix Klanner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"38160eaf9df957ffe73676379bc3e922","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/zhang-2020-ins/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.946074Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/zhang-2020-ins/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Hierarchical Category Transition for Next POI Recommendation with Uncertain Check-ins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Zhou","Zhu Sun","Guibing Guo","Yuan Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f35ac63642907216abf18010b928f8e0","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/zhou-2020-pakdd/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.967955Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/zhou-2020-pakdd/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modelling Temporal Dynamics and Repeated Behaviors for Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guibing Guo","Xin Zhou","Zhu Sun","Yuan Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"d520d43f2c2cd1b490ccf86af2f51f70","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/guo-2020-neucom/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.753327Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/guo-2020-neucom/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multi-facet User Preference Learning for Fine-grained Item Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qing Guo","Zhu Sun","Yin Leng Theng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"975b36802760b843aa127e5b4e1600a3","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/guo-2019-icwe-tutorial/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.746418Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/guo-2019-icwe-tutorial/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploiting Side Information for Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qing Guo","Zhu Sun","Jie Zhang","Yin Leng Theng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"93372ada89ee1b53f8f7c319da8007f8","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/guo-2019-icwe-short/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.743361Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/guo-2019-icwe-short/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Heterogeneous Influences for Point-of-Interest Recommendation in Location-Based Social Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Qing Guo","Jie Yang","Hui Fang","Guibing Guo","Jie Zhang","Robin Burke"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"12a131498bd159c6711ce77f31fcf35c","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2019-ecra/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.854594Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2019-ecra/","section":"publication","summary":"Recommender systems have become an essential tool to help resolve the information overload problem in recent decades.

This Research Commentary aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic survey of the recent research on recommender systems with side information. Specifically, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with side information from two orthogonal perspectives. One involves the different methodologies of recommendation: the memory-based methods, latent factor, representation learning, and deep learning models. The others cover different representations of side information, including structural data (flat, network, and hierarchical features, and knowledge graphs); and non-structural data (text, image and video features).

Prior work mainly focuses on the influence of vertically affiliated features (i.e. child-parent) on user-item interactions. The relationships of horizontally organized features (i.e. siblings and cousins) in the hierarchy, however, has only been little investigated. We show in real-world datasets that feature relationships in horizontal dimension can help explain and further model user-item interactions. To fully exploit FH, we propose a unified recommendation framework that seamlessly incorporates both vertical and horizontal dimensions for effective recommendation. Our model further considers two types of semantically rich feature relationships in horizontal dimension, i.e. complementary and alternative relationships. Extensive validation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach against the state of the art. An additional benefit of our model is to provide better interpretations of the generated recommendations.","tags":null,"title":"Exploiting both Vertical and Horizontal Dimensions of Feature hierarchy for Effective Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenjie Pei","Jie Yang","Zhu Sun","Jie Zhang","Alessandro Bozzon","David Tax"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"2a06058b76238537e7efe511c123ec0f","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/pei-2017-cikm/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.791377Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/pei-2017-cikm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Interactive Attention-Gated Recurrent Networks for Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Guibing Guo","Jie Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"ae9bd81799b4a479d0c56cc00ce96013","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2017-sac/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.844696Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2017-sac/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Learning Hierarchical Category Influence on both Users and Items for Effective Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Jie Yang","Jie Zhang","Alessandro Bozzon","Yu Chen","Chi Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"ec9b77735c5011db56b3ae0f4c980059","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2017-ijcai/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.841205Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2017-ijcai/","section":"publication","summary":"Representation learning (RL) has recently proven to be effective in capturing local item relationships by modeling item co-occurrence in individual user's interaction record. However, the value of RL for recommendation has not reached the full potential due to two major drawbacks: 1) recommendation is modeled as a rating prediction problem but should essentially be a personalized ranking one; 2) multi-level organizations of items are neglected for fine-grained item relationships. We design a unified Bayesian framework MRLR to learn user and item embeddings from a multi-level item organization, thus benefiting from RL as well as achieving the goal of personalized ranking. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows that MRLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"MRLR: Multi-level Representation Learning for Personalized Ranking in Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chang Xu","Jie Zhang","Zhu Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"672de0c99ec44564b6adf24bcd925a6b","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/xu-2017-ijcai/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.907896Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/xu-2017-ijcai/","section":"publication","summary":"Reputation fraud campaigns (RFCs) distort the reputations of rated items, by generating fake ratings through multiple spammers. One effective way of detecting RFCs is to characterize their collective behaviors based on rating histories.However, these campaigns are constantly evolving and changing tactics to evade detection.For example, they can launch early attacks on the items to quickly dominate the reputations.They can also whitewash themselves through creating new accounts for subsequent attacks.It is thus challenging for existing approaches working on historical data to promptly react to such emerging fraud activities.In this paper, we conduct RFC detection in online fashion, so as to spot campaign activities as early as possible.This leads to a unified and scalable optimization framework, FraudScan, that can adapt to emerging fraud patterns over time.Empirical analysis on two real-world datasets validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.","tags":null,"title":"Online Reputation Fraud Campaign Detection in User Ratings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Guibing Guo","Jie Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"799c6ac4281cb27c2b5b3ce25b3a34a3","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2016-umap/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.834542Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2016-umap/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Effective Recommendation with Category Hierarchy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jie Yang","Zhu Sun","Alessandro Bozzon","Jie Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"343839482acd852dac23dd7cf9767563","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/yang-2016-recsys/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.912515Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/yang-2016-recsys/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Learning Hierarchical Feature Influence for Recommendation by Recursive Regularization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihuai Qiu","Jie Zhang","Guibing Guo","Zhu Sun","Haithanh Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"6a15716b5eb5eea4aff2245f1b5cfed3","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/qiu-2016-umap/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.794385Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/qiu-2016-umap/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"TBPR: Trinity Preference based Bayesian Personalized Ranking for Multivariate Implicit Feedback","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Guibing Guo","Jie Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"2f37e24824ce5284258bd9ab2b4a95ec","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2015-umap/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.828374Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2015-umap/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploiting Implicit Item Relationships for Recommender Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"c6cf2786e2ad016f16173024c6cd3eef","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2015-umap-dc/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.831574Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/sun-2015-umap-dc/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploiting Item and User Relationships for Recommender Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guibing Guo","Jie Zhang","Zhu Sun","Neil Yorke-Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"b8bc0b32924ee3e357a879e2f160747f","permalink":"http://localhost:1399/tumplab.github.io/publication/guo-2015-umap/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.736104Z","relpermalink":"/tumplab.github.io/publication/guo-2015-umap/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"LibRec: A Java Library for Recommender Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"[Nov 2025] Welcome Prof. Li Zhou to our team as a Visiting Professor!\n[Nov 2025] Welcome Yu Lei to our team as a Visiting PhD student!\n[Nov 2025] One paper has been accepted by AAAI 2026 Main Technical Track, and one paper has been accepted by the Student Abstract and Poster Program.
