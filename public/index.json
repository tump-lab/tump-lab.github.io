Capturing user intentions\nto infer user interest accordingly has proven to be effective in enhancing the accuracy\nof SRSs. However, existing techniques assume that all sessions have the same number\nof intentions or that the items in one category belonging to the same session reflect\nthe same intention. In real applications, such as e-commerce, sessions may have\ndifferent numbers of intentions, and the same type of items in a session may correspond\nto different intentions. As a result, existing techniques cannot guarantee high-quality\nuser interest prediction. In this article, we propose a novel Adaptive Intention\nLearning Network (AILN) to capture an adaptive number of intentions for each session,\nthereby enhancing the accuracy of user interest inference. Specifically, we design\nan intention evaluation network (IEN) to evaluate whether a subsequence of a session\ncorresponds to a valid intention, and an intention generation network (IGN) to learn\nthe representation of a valid intention. By checking each subsequence of a session,\nIEN and IGN enable the incremental learning of a session-specific intention hierarchy\n(IH) to store valid intentions of the session. To reduce the cost of building the\nIH, we propose a pruning strategy that exploits the intention validity to avoid\nunnecessary evaluation. The representative intentions are selected from IH and input\ninto a designed interest predictor to infer the user interest. Experimental results\non two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed AILN.\n","tags":null,"title":"Adaptive Intention Learning for Session-based Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu Zhang","Chen Li","Yu Lei","Zhu Sun","Guanfeng Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"44f51db08b98fba6b722222c76a013d7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/zhang-2024-sigir/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.956537Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2024-sigir/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"An Empirical Analysis on Multi-turn Conversational Recommender Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xinghua Qu","Zhu Sun","Shanshan Feng","Caishun Chen","Tian Tian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"2bb5e7f43b69dc2f28c95d871bd38acf","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/qu-2024-cai/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.815383Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qu-2024-cai/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Breaking the Silence: Whisper-Driven Emotion Recognition in AI Mental Support Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huizhong Guo","Dongxia Wang","Zhu Sun","Haonan Zhang","Jinfeng Liu","Jie Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"a98c9572540d3e96f003507e11ed1471","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/guo-2024-sigir/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.756352Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-2024-sigir/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Configurable Fairness for New Item Recommendation Considering Entry Time of Items","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yingpeng Du","Ziyan Wang","Zhu Sun","Yining Ma","Hongzhi Liu","Jie Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"97ea6a5962062113e6ff67a936955079","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/du-2024-kdd/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.723515Z","relpermalink":"/publication/du-2024-kdd/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Disentangled Multi-interest Representation Learning for Sequential Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Hongyang Liu","Xinghua Qu","Kaidong Feng","Yan Wang","Yew Soon Ong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"cd14d4d112420eb504f3056ade820475","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/sun-2024-sigir-llm/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.879016Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2024-sigir-llm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Large Language Models for Intent-Driven Session Recommendations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Kaidong Feng","Jie Yang","Hui Fang","Xinghua Qu","Yew-Soon Ong","Wenyuan Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"036e29b9e951fafa869bf977199359d3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/sun-2024-tors/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.882071Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2024-tors/","section":"publication","summary":"Product bundling represents a prevalent marketing strategy in both offline\nstores and e-commerce systems. Despite its widespread use, previous studies on bundle\nrecommendation face two significant limitations. Firstly, they rely on noisy datasets,\nwhere bundles are defined by heuristics, e.g., products co-purchased in the same\nsession. Secondly, they target specific tasks by holding unrealistic assumptions,\ne.g., the availability of bundles for recommendation directly. This paper proposes\nto take a step back and considers the process of bundle recommendation from a holistic\nuser experience perspective. We first construct high-quality bundle datasets with\nrich metadata, particularly bundle intents, through a carefully designed crowd-sourcing\ntask. We then define a series of tasks that together, support all key steps in a\ntypical bundle recommendation process, from bundle detection, completion and ranking,\nto explanation and auto-naming, whereby 19 research questions are raised correspondingly\nto guide the analysis. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and analyses with\nrepresentative recommendation models and large language models (LLMs), demonstrating\nthe challenges and opportunities, especially with the emergence of LLMs. To summarize,\nour study contributes by introducing novel data sources, paving the way for new\nresearch avenues, and offering insights to guide product bundling in real e-commerce\nplatforms.\n","tags":null,"title":"Revisiting Bundle Recommendation for Intent-aware Product Bundling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Youchen Sun (PhD, NTU, Singapore)","Zhu Sun","Yingpeng Du","Jie Zhang","Yew-Soon Ong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"a77632954875a0818ea6a25ff875f15d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/youchen-2024-kdd/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.938816Z","relpermalink":"/publication/youchen-2024-kdd/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Self-Supervised Denoising through Independent Cascade Graph Augmentation for Robust Social Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haoyan Chua","Yingpeng Du","Zhu Sun","Ziyan Wang","Jie Zhang","Yew-Soon Ong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"69bceeeec2c245e155f5fe45ceb31cca","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/chua-2024-recsys/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.717492Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chua-2024-recsys/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Unified Denoising Training for Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shanshan Feng","Haoming Lyu","Fan Li","Zhu Sun","Caishun Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"902b2168d9cb104735fc4b544ae1d074","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/feng-2024-cai/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.732377Z","relpermalink":"/publication/feng-2024-cai/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Where to Move Next: Zero-shot Generalization of LLMs for Next POI Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huizi Wu","Hui Fang","Zhu Sun","Cong Geng","Yew-Soon Ong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"c0910f79021d798a86e6ecbb3fa277ad","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wu-2023-icde/","publishdate":"2025-11-24T20:17:03.180915Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-2023-icde/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Generic Reinforced Explainable Framework with Knowledge Graph for Session-based Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Yu Lei","Lu Zhang","Chen Li","Yew-Soon Ong","Jie Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"c97deb50d3db5fb6c80aba0dcf80d9b0","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/sun-2023-tois-poi/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.871703Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2023-tois-poi/","section":"publication","summary":"'Current study on next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation mainly explores\nuser sequential transitions with the fine-grained individual-user POI check-in trajectories\nonly, which suffers from the severe check-in data sparsity issue.

Most of the existing SBRSs mainly strive to improve recommendation accuracy by exploiting different deep learning techniques to represent each user on the basis of the most recent session. However, they generally ignore to capture the diversity preference at the session level. In this view, we consider both recommendation diversity and accuracy when generating recommendations. Particularly, we treat that users’ preferences towards diversity might be varied across users (sessions). Thus, we propose an end-to-end neural network model, namely Purpose Tendency-aware Diversified Strategy for Session-based Recommendation (PTDS-SR), where we design a Purpose Tendency Probability (PTP) module matching with a two-channel decoder to guide whether to recommend similar or diversified items given a session. We thus obtain a relatively personalized strategy for each session to exploit the diversity to facilitate recommendation accuracy regarding short-term user preferences (within a session). We compare our approach with representative, state-of-the-art baselines on three real-world datasets, in terms of recommendation accuracy, diversity and a comprehensive metric (considering both accuracy and diversity).

Meanwhile, it is unclear how the accuracy-oriented SBRSs perform\nin terms of diversity. In addition, the asserted “tradeoff” relationship between\naccuracy and diversity has been increasingly questioned in the literature. Toward\nthe aforementioned issues, we conduct a holistic study to particularly examine the\nrecommendation performance of representative SBRSs w.r.t. both accuracy and diversity,\nstriving for better understanding of the diversity-related issues for SBRSs and\nproviding guidance on designing diversified SBRSs. Particularly, for a fair and\nthorough comparison, we deliberately select state-of-the-art non-neural, deep neural,\nand diversified SBRSs by covering more scenarios with appropriate experimental setups,\ne.g., representative datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyper-parameter optimization\ntechnique. The source code can be obtained via github.com/qyin863/Understanding-Diversity-in-SBRSs\n. Our empirical results unveil that (1) non-diversified methods can also obtain\nsatisfying performance on diversity, which can even surpass diversified ones, and\n(2) the relationship between accuracy and diversity is quite complex. Besides the\n“tradeoff” relationship, they can be positively correlated with each other, that\nis, having a same-trend (win–win or lose–lose) relationship, which varies across\ndifferent methods and datasets.

However, such an assumption\nnot only makes the robustness improvement more expensive but may also leave a model\nless effective to other kinds of attacks in the wild. In contrast, we propose an\nadversary agnostic robust DRL paradigm that does not require learning from adversaries.\nTo this end, we first theoretically derive that robustness could indeed be achieved\nindependently of the adversaries based on a policy distillation setting. Motivated\nby this finding, we propose a new policy distillation loss with two terms: 1) a\nprescription gap maximization loss aiming at simultaneously maximizing the likelihood\nof the action selected by the teacher policy and the entropy over the remaining\nactions; 2) a corresponding Jacobian regularization loss that minimizes the magnitude\nof the gradient with respect to the input state.

We formulate\nthe adversarial attack by accommodating the three key settings and explore their\npotency on six Atari games by examining four fully trained state-of-the-art policies.\nIn Breakout, for example, we surprisingly find that: (i) all policies showcase significant\nperformance degradation by merely modifying 0.01% of the input state, and (ii) the\npolicy trained by DQN is totally deceived by perturbation to only 1% frames.\"\n","tags":null,"title":"Minimalistic Attacks: How Little it Takes to Fool a Deep Reinforcement Learning Policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lu Zhang","Zhu Sun","Jie Zhang","Horst Kloeden","Felix Klanner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"38160eaf9df957ffe73676379bc3e922","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/zhang-2020-ins/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.946074Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2020-ins/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Hierarchical Category Transition for Next POI Recommendation with Uncertain Check-ins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Zhou","Zhu Sun","Guibing Guo","Yuan Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f35ac63642907216abf18010b928f8e0","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/zhou-2020-pakdd/","publishdate":"2025-11-24T20:17:03.183356Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhou-2020-pakdd/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modelling Temporal Dynamics and Repeated Behaviors for Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guibing Guo","Xin Zhou","Zhu Sun","Yuan Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"d520d43f2c2cd1b490ccf86af2f51f70","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/guo-2020-neucom/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.753327Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-2020-neucom/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multi-facet User Preference Learning for Fine-grained Item Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qing Guo","Zhu Sun","Yin Leng Theng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"975b36802760b843aa127e5b4e1600a3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/guo-2019-icwe-tutorial/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.746418Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-2019-icwe-tutorial/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploiting Side Information for Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qing Guo","Zhu Sun","Jie Zhang","Yin Leng Theng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"93372ada89ee1b53f8f7c319da8007f8","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/guo-2019-icwe-short/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.743361Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-2019-icwe-short/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Heterogeneous Influences for Point-of-Interest Recommendation in Location-Based Social Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Qing Guo","Jie Yang","Hui Fang","Guibing Guo","Jie Zhang","Robin Burke"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"12a131498bd159c6711ce77f31fcf35c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/sun-2019-ecra/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.854594Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2019-ecra/","section":"publication","summary":"'Recommender systems have become an essential tool to help resolve the information\noverload problem in recent decades. Traditional recommender systems, however, suffer\nfrom data sparsity and cold start problems. To address these issues, a great number\nof recommendation algorithms have been proposed to leverage side information of\nusers or items (e.g., social network and item category), demonstrating a high degree\nof effectiveness in improving recommendation performance. This Research Commentary\naims to provide a comprehensive and systematic survey of the recent research on\nrecommender systems with side information. Specifically, we provide an overview\nof state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with side information from two orthogonal\nperspectives. One involves the different methodologies of recommendation: the memory-based\nmethods, latent factor, representation learning, and deep learning models. The others\ncover different representations of side information, including structural data (flat,\nnetwork, and hierarchical features, and knowledge graphs); and non-structural data\n(text, image and video features). Finally, we discuss challenges and provide new\npotential directions in recommendation, along with the conclusion of this survey.'\n","tags":null,"title":"Research Commentary on Recommendations with Side Information: A Survey and Research Directions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yun Liu","Huihuai Qiu","Guibing Guo","Zhu Sun","Jie Zhang","Hai Thanh Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4993be56dec1743a66b7e97f93c332fe","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/liu-2018-ins/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.785127Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-2018-ins/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"BPRH: Bayesian Personalized Ranking for Heterogeneous Implicit Feedback","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Jie Yang","Jie Zhang","Alessandro Bozzon","Longkai Huang","Chi Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"108c97d444bea0a34248df7b5a0f4556","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/sun-2018-recsys/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.851068Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2018-recsys/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Recurrent Knowledge Graph Embedding for Effective Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Guibing Guo","Jie Zhang","Chi Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"7d551f862029a09d49df48af75d94035","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/sun-2017-umap/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.847689Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2017-umap/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Unified Latent Factor Model for Effective Category-Aware Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qing Guo","Zhu Sun","Jie Zhang","Qi Chen","Yin-Leng Theng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"d3692b56b73c5489a64f792b4417513e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/guo-2017-umap/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.740206Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-2017-umap/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Aspect-Aware Point-of-Interest Recommendation with Geo-Social Influence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhu Sun","Jie Yang","Jie Zhang","Alessandro Bozzon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"80f2ef6bc9a9c2f77ce63acf28707083","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/sun-2017-aaai/","publishdate":"2025-08-14T14:34:46.837475Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-2017-aaai/","section":"publication","summary":"Feature hierarchy (FH) has proven to be effective to improve recommendation\naccuracy.
