abstract: |
  Feature hierarchy (FH) has proven to be effective to improve recommendation
  accuracy. Prior work mainly focuses on the influence of vertically affiliated features
  (i.e. child-parent) on user-item interactions. The relationships of horizontally
  organized features (i.e. siblings and cousins) in the hierarchy, however, has only
  been little investigated. We show in real-world datasets that feature relationships
  in horizontal dimension can help explain and further model user-item interactions.
  To fully exploit FH, we propose a unified recommendation framework that seamlessly
  incorporates both vertical and horizontal dimensions for effective recommendation.
  Our model further considers two types of semantically rich feature relationships
  in horizontal dimension, i.e. complementary and alternative relationships. Extensive
  validation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach
  against the state of the art. An additional benefit of our model is to provide better
  interpretations of the generated recommendations.
