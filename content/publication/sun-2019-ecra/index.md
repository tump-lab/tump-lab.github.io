abstract: 'Recommender systems have become an essential tool to help resolve the information
  overload problem in recent decades. Traditional recommender systems, however, suffer
  from data sparsity and cold start problems. To address these issues, a great number
  of recommendation algorithms have been proposed to leverage side information of
  users or items (e.g., social network and item category), demonstrating a high degree
  of effectiveness in improving recommendation performance. This Research Commentary
  aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic survey of the recent research on
  recommender systems with side information. Specifically, we provide an overview
  of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with side information from two orthogonal
  perspectives. One involves the different methodologies of recommendation: the memory-based
  methods, latent factor, representation learning, and deep learning models. The others
  cover different representations of side information, including structural data (flat,
  network, and hierarchical features, and knowledge graphs); and non-structural data
  (text, image and video features). Finally, we discuss challenges and provide new
  potential directions in recommendation, along with the conclusion of this survey.'
