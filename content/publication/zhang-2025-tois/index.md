  'Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to provide personalized recommendations
  to users. Recently, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely introduced in RSs to
  improve recommendation accuracy. In this study, however, we demonstrate that RSs
  do not necessarily perform worse even if the KG is downgraded to the user-item interaction
  graph only (or removed). We propose an evaluation framework KG4RecEval to systematically
  evaluate how much a KG contributes to the recommendation accuracy of a KG-based
  RS, using our defined metric KGER (KG utilization efficiency in recommendation).
  We consider the scenarios where knowledge in a KG gets completely removed, randomly
  distorted and decreased, and also where recommendations are for cold-start users.
  Our extensive experiments on four commonly used datasets and a number of state-of-the-art
  KG-based RSs reveal that: to remove, randomly distort or decrease knowledge does
  not necessarily decrease recommendation accuracy, even for cold-start users. These
  findings inspire us to rethink how to better utilize knowledge from existing KGs,
  whereby we discuss and provide insights into what characteristics of datasets and
  KG-based RSs may help improve KG utilization efficiency. The code and supplementary
  material of this paper are available at: https://github.com/HotBento/KG4RecEval.'
