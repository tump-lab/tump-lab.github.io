abstract: 'Current study on next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation mainly explores
  user sequential transitions with the fine-grained individual-user POI check-in trajectories
  only, which suffers from the severe check-in data sparsity issue. In fact, coarse-grained
  signals (i.e., region- and global-level check-ins) in such sparse check-ins would
  also benefit to augment user preference learning. Specifically, our data analysis
  unveils that user movement exhibits noticeable patterns w.r.t. the regions of visited
  POIs. Meanwhile, the global all-user check-ins can help reflect sequential regularities
  shared by the crowd. We are, therefore, inspired to propose the MCMG: a Multi-Channel
  next POI recommendation framework with Multi-Granularity signals categorized from
  two orthogonal perspectives, i.e., fine-coarse grained check-ins at either POI/region
  level or local/global level. The MCMG is equipped with three modules, namely, global
  user behavior encoder, local multi-channel (i.e., region, category, and POI channels)
  encoder, and region-aware weighting strategy. Such design enables MCMG to be capable
  of capturing both fine- and coarse-grained sequential regularities as well as exploring
  the dynamic impact of multi-channel by differentiating the check-in patterns w.r.t.
  visited regions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our
  MCMG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art next POI recommendation approaches.'
