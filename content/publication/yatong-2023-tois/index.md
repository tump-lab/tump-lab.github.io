abstract: 'Most sequential recommendation systems (SRSs) predict the next item as
  the target for users given its preceding items as input, assuming the target is
  definitely related to its input. However, users may unintentionally click items
  that are inconsistent with their preference due to external factors, causing unreliable
  instances whose target mismatches the input. We, for the first time , verify SRSs
  can be misguided by such unreliable instances and design a generic SRS framework
  B y E liminating un R eliable D ata (BERD+), which can be flexibly plugged into
  existing SRSs. Specifically, BRED+ is guided with observations on the training process
  of instances: Unreliable instances generally have high training loss; high-loss
  instances are not necessarily unreliable but uncertain ones caused by blurry sequential
  patterns; and item attributes help rectify instance loss and uncertainty, but may
  also introduce disturbance. Accordingly, BERD+ models both the loss and uncertainty
  of each instance via a Gaussian distribution, whereby a heterogeneous uncertainty-aware
  graph convolution network is designed to learn accurate embeddings for different
  entities while reducing the disturbance caused by uncertain attribute values. Thereafter,
  an explicit preference extractor rectifies instance loss and uncertainty and reduces
  the disturbance caused by less-focused attribute types. Finally, instances with
  high loss and low uncertainty are eliminated as unreliable data. Extensive experiments
  verify the efficacy of BERD+.'
