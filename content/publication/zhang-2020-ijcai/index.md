abstract: "Studies on next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation mainly seek to learn
  users' transition patterns with certain historical check-ins. However, in reality,
  users' movements are typically uncertain (i.e., fuzzy and incomplete) where most
  existing methods suffer from the transition pattern vanishing issue. To ease this
  issue, we propose a novel interactive multi-task learning (iMTL) framework to better
  exploit the interplay between activity and location preference. Specifically, iMTL
  introduces: (1) temporal-aware activity encoder equipped with fuzzy characterization
  over uncertain check-ins to unveil the latent activity transition patterns; (2)
  spatial-aware location preference encoder to capture the latent location transition
  patterns; and (3) task-specific decoder to make use of the learned latent transition
  patterns and enhance both activity and location prediction tasks in an interactive
  manner. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the superiority
  of iMTL."
