abstract: Most existing studies on next location recommendation propose to model the
  sequential regularity of check-in sequences, but suffer from the severe data sparsity
  issue where most locations have fewer than five following locations. To this end,
  we propose an Attentional Recurrent Neural Network (ARNN) to jointly model both
  the sequential regularity and transition regularities of similar locations (neighbors).
  In particular, we first design a meta-path based random walk over a novel knowledge
  graph to discover location neighbors based on heterogeneous factors. A recurrent
  neural network is then adopted to model the sequential regularity by capturing various
  contexts that govern user mobility. Meanwhile, the transition regularities of the
  discovered neighbors are integrated via the attention mechanism, which seamlessly
  cooperates with the sequential regularity as a unified recurrent framework. Experimental
  results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ARNN outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods.
