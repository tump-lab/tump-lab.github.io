  'In recent years, dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been
  proposed to capture comprehensive user preferences in order to ultimately enhance
  the recommendation accuracy in both data-richer and data-sparser domains simultaneously.
  However, in addition to users’ true preferences, the user–item interactions might
  also be affected by confounders (e.g., free shipping, sales promotion). As a result,
  dual-target CDR has to meet two challenges: (1) how to effectively decouple observed
  confounders, including single-domain confounders and cross-domain confounders, and
  (2) how to preserve the positive effects of observed confounders on predicted interactions,
  while eliminating their negative effects on capturing comprehensive user preferences.
  To address the above two challenges, we propose a Causal Deconfounding Framework
  via Confounder Disentanglement for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CD2CDR)
  . In CD2CDR, we first propose a confounder disentanglement module to effectively
  decouple observed single-domain and cross-domain confounders. We then propose a
  causal deconfounding module to preserve the positive effects of such observed confounders
  and eliminate their negative effects via backdoor adjustment, thereby enhancing
  the recommendation accuracy in each domain. Extensive experiments conducted on seven
  real-world datasets demonstrate that CD2CDR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
  methods.'
