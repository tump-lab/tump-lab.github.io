abstract: Product bundling represents a prevalent marketing strategy in both offline
  stores and e-commerce systems. Despite its widespread use, previous studies on bundle
  recommendation face two significant limitations. Firstly, they rely on noisy datasets,
  where bundles are defined by heuristics, e.g., products co-purchased in the same
  session. Secondly, they target specific tasks by holding unrealistic assumptions,
  e.g., the availability of bundles for recommendation directly. This paper proposes
  to take a step back and considers the process of bundle recommendation from a holistic
  user experience perspective. We first construct high-quality bundle datasets with
  rich metadata, particularly bundle intents, through a carefully designed crowd-sourcing
  task. We then define a series of tasks that together, support all key steps in a
  typical bundle recommendation process, from bundle detection, completion and ranking,
  to explanation and auto-naming, whereby 19 research questions are raised correspondingly
  to guide the analysis. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and analyses with
  representative recommendation models and large language models (LLMs), demonstrating
  the challenges and opportunities, especially with the emergence of LLMs. To summarize,
  our study contributes by introducing novel data sources, paving the way for new
  research avenues, and offering insights to guide product bundling in real e-commerce
  platforms.
