abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have proven to be effective for high-quality recommendation,
  where the connectivities between users and items provide rich and complementary
  information to user-item interactions. Most existing methods, however, are insufficient
  to exploit the KGs for capturing user preferences, as they either represent the
  user-item connectivities via paths with limited expressiveness or implicitly model
  them by propagating information over the entire KG with inevitable noise. In this
  paper, we design a novel hierarchical attentive knowledge graph embedding (HAKG)
  framework to exploit the KGs for effective recommendation. Specifically, HAKG first
  extracts the expressive subgraphs that link user-item pairs to characterize their
  connectivities, which accommodate both the semantics and topology of KGs. The subgraphs
  are then encoded via a hierarchical attentive subgraph encoding to generate effective
  subgraph embeddings for enhanced user preference prediction. Extensive experiments
  show the superiority of HAKG against state-of-the-art recommendation methods, as
  well as its potential in alleviating the data sparsity issue.
