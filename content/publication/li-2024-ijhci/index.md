abstract: |
  In recent years, the potential applications of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)
  in fields such as healthcare, social psychology, and industrial design have attracted
  wide research attention, providing new directions for human factors research. For
  instance, LMM-based smart systems have become novel research subjects of human factors
  studies, and LMM introduces new research paradigms and methodologies to this field.
  Therefore, this paper aims to explore the applications, challenges, and future prospects
  of LMM in the domain of human factors and ergonomics through an expert-LMM collaborated
  literature review. Specifically, a novel literature review method is proposed, and
  research studies of LMM-based accident analysis, human modelling and intervention
  design are introduced. Subsequently, the paper discusses future trends of the research
  paradigm and challenges of human factors and ergonomics studies in the era of LMMs.
  It is expected that this study can provide a valuable perspective and serve as a
  reference for integrating human factors with artificial intelligence.
